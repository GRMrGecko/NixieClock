#Nixie Tube Clock - Arduino Controlled Clock

I don't have any fun names to put on this project, I haven't thought of one... If you have one, email me.

All details has not been written out, but you can piece together things by going to my blog at http://mrgecko.org and viewing images and docs here.

You would want to use Modified Board to print as I include the needed gerber files and also it has pin outs for power which is useful for adding the bluetooth board.

Many of the parts used is available at https://www.sparkfun.com/wish_lists/83348 I recommend buying the needed resistors from some place where you can order them individually.

To get nixie tubes, I recommend you go on ebay and search for "Nixie Tube IN 14" without quotes.

Power Supply can be ordered from http://www.allspectrum.com/store/nixie-power-supply-high-voltage-switch-mode-dc-dc-converter-kit-95-190vdc-25ma-180vdc-p-521.html
The tube ICs can be purchased from http://www.allspectrum.com/store/74141-nixie-tube-driver-ic-russian-p-211.html, you will need 6.
